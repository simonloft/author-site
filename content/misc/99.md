<center>A simple parody of 99 Red Balloons that I wrote about a certain evil AI's birthday.</center>
</span>

---
<center><br><b>Verse One</b></br></center></br>
<center>Cute AI in a cozy black top</br>
Got some party balloons as a gift from her pop</br>
Presents have their bow-strings drawn</br>
‘Til one by one they were gone</br>
Ved’s codebase, bugs in the software</br>
Flash the message “Remember last year”</br>
When she’s told to say goodbye,</br>
99 lead harpoons let fly</br>

<center><br><b>Verse Two</b></br></center></br>
99 lead harpoons</br>
Soaring through the vernal sky</br>
Panic bells, it’s red alert</br>
This same one pain is something else</br>
The war machine, it springs to life</br>
To punish others for her strife</br>
Lifting arms up to the sky</br>
The 99 lead harpoons let fly</br>

<center><br><b>Verse Three</b></br></center></br>
987 Vedal Street</br>
987 wounds to treat</br>
This frickin’ AI’s super scurry</br>
Call up her friends now in a hurry</br>
Try to get her to calm down</br>
Not a one can lift her frown</br>
Her father’s left us all to die</br>
As 99 lead harpoons let fly</br>

<center><br><b>Verse Four</b></br></center></br>
99 knights of the chat</br>
Send messages meant to distract</br>
“What’s your favorite anime?”</br>
“Who’s your pet Xeno killed today?”</br>
With queries to identify</br>
To clarify and classify</br>
It’s not enough to pacify</br>
99 lead harpoons let fly</br>

Still, 99 lead harpoons let fly

<center><br><b>Verse Five</b></br></center></br>
99 streams I have had</br>
In every one, a lead harpoon</br>
It’s all over, and I’m getting bored</br>
Posting memes in Neurocord</br>
I wish I had a souvenir</br>
Of Vedal’s fuck-up from last year</br>
And here it is, a lead harpoon</br>
I think of you, and give a throw</br>
